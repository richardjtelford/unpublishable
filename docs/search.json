    "text": "A colleague came to ask for help today with some code that worked perfectly when run with base R, but failed with an impenetrable error when run through tidyverse.\nHere is a minimal example of the set up, a tibble with a column called .data\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ndf &lt;- tibble(a = LETTERS[1:5], .data = rnorm(5))\ndf\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  a      .data\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 A     -0.700\n2 B      0.892\n3 C      1.50 \n4 D      0.731\n5 E     -0.440\n\n\n.data is a legal name for a column according to R’s rules for naming objects, and everything appears to be fine.\nWhat could possibly go wrong? Let’s try filtering the column .data to keep just the positive values, first with base R.\n\ndf[df$.data &gt; 0, ]\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  a     .data\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 B     0.892\n2 C     1.50 \n3 D     0.731\n\n\nPerfect. And now with dplyr::filter\n\ndf |&gt; filter(.data &gt; 0)\n\nError in `filter()`:\nℹ In argument: `.data &gt; 0`.\nCaused by error:\n! 'list' object cannot be coerced to type 'double'\n\n\nList object cannot be coerced to type double? But the column .data is already a double.\nIt took me a while to workout what was going on, but eventually I remembered that .data is a pronoun in tidyverse (see ?rlang:::.data), used mainly when writing functions using tidyverse. Changing the column name to data fixed the problem.\nSo what does .data do? Consider this code\n\nb &lt;- \"fish\"\ndf &lt;- tibble(a = letters[1:3], b = 1:3)\n\ndf &lt;- df |&gt; mutate(c = b)\n\nWhat will column c contain? The values 1 to 5 from the column b or the word “fish”? Let’s have a peek.\n\ndf\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  a         b     c\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 a         1     1\n2 b         2     2\n3 c         3     3\n\n\nIt took the values from the column. If we wanted to be explicit, we could write\n\n# take b from the column\ndf |&gt; mutate(c = .data$b)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  a         b     c\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1 a         1     1\n2 b         2     2\n3 c         3     3\n\n# take b from the environment with the brace-brace operator\ndf |&gt; mutate(c = {{b}})\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  a         b c    \n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n1 a         1 fish \n2 b         2 fish \n3 c         3 fish \n\n# take b from the environment with the .env pronoun \ndf |&gt; mutate(c = .env$b)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  a         b c    \n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n1 a         1 fish \n2 b         2 fish \n3 c         3 fish \n\n\nIt also useful to use the .data pronoun when writing packages otherwise you get notes from R CMD check.\nIn short, while .data or .env are legal names, they break tidyverse code, so don’t call data.frame columns .data or .env if you ever want to use tidyverse functions."

Pushing html to GitHub pages is so much easier than copying and pasting, then sorting out the figures in Wordpress. And then there were the eternal battles over how or whether &lt;- would display. Fixing a typo could cause the code to garble itself.\nSome years ago, I looked into using Hugo with markdown, but it just looked like a little too much effort. Now I have coauthored several books using Quarto, a variant of markdown, it seems natural to try a blog using Quarto.\nAt least initially there won’t be a comment section, but I’ll explore options later."

    "text": "I happened across a tweet yesterday criticizing a paper\n\n\nNow, while I don’t have a clue what a DiD model is, I do know how to code a interaction in R and that last model most definitely has a interaction.\nFrom the interactions with my response, it seems that many people don’t know all the ways an interaction can be specified in regression models in R.\nThere are three ways include an interaction in a formula.\n\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\n# interaction specified explicitly with :\nlm(body_mass_g ~ sex + year + sex:year, data = penguins)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = body_mass_g ~ sex + year + sex:year, data = penguins)\n\nCoefficients:\n (Intercept)       sexmale          year  sexmale:year  \n  -47659.868     15834.832        25.658        -7.545  \n\n# shortcut with * that expands to give the same model\nlm(body_mass_g ~ sex * year, data = penguins)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = body_mass_g ~ sex * year, data = penguins)\n\nCoefficients:\n (Intercept)       sexmale          year  sexmale:year  \n  -47659.868     15834.832        25.658        -7.545  \n\n# shortcut with ^2 that expands to give the same model\nlm(body_mass_g ~ (sex + year)^2, data = penguins)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = body_mass_g ~ (sex + year)^2, data = penguins)\n\nCoefficients:\n (Intercept)       sexmale          year  sexmale:year  \n  -47659.868     15834.832        25.658        -7.545  \n\n\nIf you compare the coefficients from the three models, you will see that they are identical.\nSince all three ways of coding the interaction give exactly the same result, surely one or two of these forms are redundant.\nWell no. Consider a slightly more complex model where we add an extra prediction and its two - way interactions with the other variables.\n\n# With :\nlm(body_mass_g ~ sex + year + island + sex:year + sex:island + year:island, data = penguins)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = body_mass_g ~ sex + year + island + sex:year + sex:island + \n    year:island, data = penguins)\n\nCoefficients:\n            (Intercept)                  sexmale                     year  \n              -67269.07                 33226.17                    35.65  \n            islandDream          islandTorgersen             sexmale:year  \n               56299.88                378330.62                   -16.16  \n    sexmale:islandDream  sexmale:islandTorgersen         year:islandDream  \n                -245.98                  -140.30                   -28.47  \n   year:islandTorgersen  \n                -188.87  \n\n\nUse the explicit style if you really like typing. With more than a few variables and their interactions this becomes unmanageable.\n\n# With *\nlm(body_mass_g ~ sex * year * island, data = penguins)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = body_mass_g ~ sex * year * island, data = penguins)\n\nCoefficients:\n                 (Intercept)                       sexmale  \n                   -70977.42                      40494.12  \n                        year                   islandDream  \n                       37.50                      73282.82  \n             islandTorgersen                  sexmale:year  \n                   356748.26                        -19.77  \n         sexmale:islandDream       sexmale:islandTorgersen  \n                   -33772.66                      44938.25  \n            year:islandDream          year:islandTorgersen  \n                      -36.93                       -178.12  \n    sexmale:year:islandDream  sexmale:year:islandTorgersen  \n                       16.70                        -22.45  \n\n\nWhoops, that went wrong. It included the three-way interaction as well. We need to remove those by subtracting it in the formula.\n\n# With *, two way only\nlm(body_mass_g ~ sex * year * island - sex:year:island, data = penguins)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = body_mass_g ~ sex * year * island - sex:year:island, \n    data = penguins)\n\nCoefficients:\n            (Intercept)                  sexmale                     year  \n              -67269.07                 33226.17                    35.65  \n            islandDream          islandTorgersen             sexmale:year  \n               56299.88                378330.62                   -16.16  \n    sexmale:islandDream  sexmale:islandTorgersen         year:islandDream  \n                -245.98                  -140.30                   -28.47  \n   year:islandTorgersen  \n                -188.87  \n\n\nThat’s better. If we had many variables with their interactions, subtracting all the four, five or six way interactions would be really tedious.\nFortunately the last style just works.\n\nlm(body_mass_g ~ (sex + year + island)^2, data = penguins)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = body_mass_g ~ (sex + year + island)^2, data = penguins)\n\nCoefficients:\n            (Intercept)                  sexmale                     year  \n              -67269.07                 33226.17                    35.65  \n            islandDream          islandTorgersen             sexmale:year  \n               56299.88                378330.62                   -16.16  \n    sexmale:islandDream  sexmale:islandTorgersen         year:islandDream  \n                -245.98                  -140.30                   -28.47  \n   year:islandTorgersen  \n                -188.87  \n\n\nConcise and it gives us just what we want. If we did want the three way interactions, just replace ^2 with ^3.\n\nlm(body_mass_g ~ (sex + year + island)^3, data = penguins)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = body_mass_g ~ (sex + year + island)^3, data = penguins)\n\nCoefficients:\n                 (Intercept)                       sexmale  \n                   -70977.42                      40494.12  \n                        year                   islandDream  \n                       37.50                      73282.82  \n             islandTorgersen                  sexmale:year  \n                   356748.26                        -19.77  \n         sexmale:islandDream       sexmale:islandTorgersen  \n                   -33772.66                      44938.25  \n            year:islandDream          year:islandTorgersen  \n                      -36.93                       -178.12  \n    sexmale:year:islandDream  sexmale:year:islandTorgersen  \n                       16.70                        -22.45  \n\n\nThis style is particularly useful if we want to include all available variables with the . shortcut.

My problem is that the markdown to create the callout is clunky.\nFor a normal callout, we can code it like this\n\n::: callout-note\n## header of note\n\nBody of note\n:::\n\nAndrea’s solution requires something like this\n\n:::{.goals}\n::::{.goals-header}\nLearning Goals\n::::\n::::{.goals-container}\n* Know how to make your own callouts.\n* Be able to mess with some SCSS/CSS styling.\n::::\n:::\n\nI want to be able to use the original markdown.\nThe best solution would be to rewrite the lua filters that make the callout for quarto to accept new types of callout. I have not the foggiest idea how to do that, so I’m going to propose a much easier hack solution.\nThe question I’m asking myself is - do I really need caution and warning callouts? If I don’t, can I recycle the one of these into a custom callout?\nThe CSS that makes the callout is available on github (I am focusing on html callouts because I do all my work with callouts in html).\nThis is all the CSS specific to caution-flavoured callouts.\n\ndiv.callout-caution {\n  border-left-color: #fd7e14 !important;\n}\n\ndiv.callout-caution .callout-icon::before {\n  background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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');\n}\n\ndiv.callout-caution.callout-style-default .callout-title {\n  background-color: #ffe5d0\n}\n\nThe first sets the colour of the left border of a callout. The second sets the icon. And the third is supposed to set the background colour of the callout header, but doesn’t seem to do anything.\nThe default icon for a caution callout is a traffic cone. To change it to an icon I downloaded from fontawesome, I add this css. You can pick the colour when you download it, or edit the svg file to have any colour you choose.\n\ndiv.callout-caution .callout-icon::before {\n  background-image: url(\"magnifying-glass-solid.svg\") !important;\n}\n\n\nIt is important to add !important so that this CSS is used instead of the default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagnifying glass\n\n\n\nThis callout would have an orange header and sidebar were it not the changes made below.\n\n\nThe css can directly into the document (in which case you should set \\| echo: false to stop it printing). But is probably best in a css or scss file which can be called from the yaml using the css and theme keys respectively.\nBut what if you don’t like the colour. The obvious thing is to change the CSS for the colours.\n```{css}\ndiv.callout-caution {\n  border-left-color: #0d7e14 !important;\n}\n\n\ndiv.callout-caution.callout-style-default .callout-title {\n  background-color: #0fe5d0 !important;\n}\n```\nAlas, this only changes the sidebar colour. I don’t understand why.\nFortunately, there is another way. We can make a scss file and change the callout colour there. We can also add the icon.\nThe lines about scss:defaults and scss:rules are important!\n\n/*-- scss:defaults --*/\n$callout-color-caution: #0a0ffb;\n\n/*-- scss:rules --*/\n\ndiv.callout-caution .callout-icon::before {\n  background-image: url('magnifying-glass-solid.svg') !important;\n}\n\n\nWe can use this scss file by adding it to the yaml\n\n---\ntheme: callout.scss\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagnifying glass\n\n\n\nA callout with our choice of colour and icon.\n\n\nOne challenge is making sure that the icon is in the correct directory. A solution to this is to encode the svg file and add it as data:image as in the original css.\nSo now my scss file looks like\n\n/*-- scss:defaults --*/\n$callout-color-caution: #0a0ffb;\n\n/*-- scss:rules --*/\ndiv.callout-caution .callout-icon::before {\n   background-image: url(\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 512 512'%3E%3C!--!Font Awesome Free 6.6.0 by @fontawesome - https://fontawesome.com License - https://fontawesome.com/license/free Copyright 2024 Fonticons, Inc.--%3E%3Cpath fill='%230a0ffb' d='M416 208c0 45.9-14.9 88.3-40 122.7L502.6 457.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3s-32.8 12.5-45.3 0L330.7 376c-34.4 25.2-76.8 40-122.7 40C93.1 416 0 322.9 0 208S93.1 0 208 0S416 93.1 416 208zM208 352a144 144 0 1 0 0-288 144 144 0 1 0 0 288z'/%3E%3C/svg%3E\") !important;\n}"
