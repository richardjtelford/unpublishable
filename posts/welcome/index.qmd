For many years, I had a [wordpress blog](https://quantpalaeo.wordpress.com/).

Once I started using markdown and GitHub, I began to find the Wordpress publication process tedious.
Pushing html to GitHub pages is so much easier than copying and pasting, then sorting out the figures in Wordpress.
And then there were the eternal battles over how or whether `<-` would display.
Fixing a typo could cause the code to garble itself.

Some years ago, I looked into using Hugo with markdown, but it just looked like a little too much effort.
Now I have coauthored [several books](https://biostats-r.github.io/biostats/) using Quarto, a variant of markdown, it seems natural to try a [blog using Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html).

At least initially there won't be a comment section, but I'll explore options later.
